The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

There were alembics with two (dibikos) and three (tribikos) receivers.[4] According to Zosimos of Panopolis, the alembic was invented by Mary the Jewess.[5]\n\nThe anbik is described by Ibn al-Awwam in his Kitab al-Filaha (Book of Agriculture), where he explains how rose-water is distilled. Amongst others, it is mentioned in the Mafatih al-Ulum (Key of Sciences) of Khwarizmi and the Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets) of Al-Razi. Some illustrations occur in the Latin translations of works which are attributed to Geber.[2]\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

    "content": "\nWeek 2: Divergence-time Estimation with Node calibrations\n\n\nQ: If you are not showing branch lengths but just a cladogram schematic of how taxa are related, and you’re rooting with an outgroup, is the FigTree “root” okay? (Context: FigTree adds an arbitrary root edge when you root an phylogram, but really the root could be anywhere along the branch leading to the outgroup.)\n\nThe “FigTree rooting problem” is just about branch lengths (where the root is placed along the branch), so a cladogram shouldn’t be compromised. AS LONG AS your outgroup is monophyletic. In many cases the outgroup isn’t truly a clade (it might include some samples from the clade sister to the ingroup, and then some samples from the clade sister to that, for example), in which case adding that “Curse of Figtree” root will result in an incorrect topology.\n\nQ: Do you have examples of uncorrelated clock models? Organisms? (Context: discussing the relative realism of autocorrelated and uncorrelated relaxed molecular clocks.)\n\nUncorrelated models are really motivated by computational tractability. Some argue that if rates of change of the rate are high, then branch rates should be uncorrelated.\n\nQ: How do you pick the type of distribution you draw your rates from (for a relaxed molecular clock)?\n\nYou can compare the fit of these models with model selection tools (in a Bayesian analysis this means a Bayes factor). See Relaxed Clocks &amp; Time Trees for an example.\n\nQ: Is node calibration applicable for fossils only datasets?\n\nIf you only have fossils, they should be tips in your tree, which is more like total-evidence dating. Node calibration is how we add temporal information to a molecular phylogeny.\n\nQ: If you have a fossil that is used to date the family you study, but you are focusing on phylogenetics of a particular genus, can you still use the fossil? Do you just include appropriate outgroups in the tree to reflect the fossil?\n\nYes, that is often called an external calibration. It is a common solution to the problem of no ingroup fossils.\n\nQ (follow up): We need the sequences of these other groups, right?\n\nYes.\n\nQ: How do you compare the effect of different calibration densities then? Or you shouldn’t compare them at all cause they are data? (Context: you can only compare models for the same data, and fossil calibrations are data.)\n\nYou can compare the effect of using different calibrations (e.g., the effect on inferred divergence times), but you can’t compare the fit.\n",

    "title": "Code of Conduct",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "(Based on Stay-At-Home RevBayes Workshop Code of Conduct found here.)\n\nPolicy on harassment and discrimination\n\nHarassment of others by any participant (attendee or instructor) will not be tolerated. Unacceptable treatment of others includes (but is not limited to) unwanted verbal attention, intimidation, stalking, shaming, or bullying. Inappropriate behavior via any medium (e.g., direct message, chats, email, video conferencing) is a violation of this code of conduct. Discrimination or exclusion on the basis of gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or similar will not be tolerated. Critiques of scientific work are appropriate and important, but all forms of communication must be free of offensive, discriminatory or disrespectful elements, including (but not limited to) words and images that are derogatory or demeaning to individuals or groups [1]. Inappropriate comments presented in a joking manner constitute unacceptable behavior. Retaliation for reporting inappropriate behavior is also unacceptable, as is reporting an incident in bad faith.\n\nWorkshop participants or instructors wishing to report a violation of this code of conduct by any member of this group can contact any of the instructors via direct message on Slack or email (provided below). Incidents of inappropriate and uncivil behavior are taken extremely seriously. Confidentiality will be maintained unless disclosure is legally required.\n\nWorkshop instructors will act as moderators in the Slack space and during interactive sessions. Instructors reserve the right to enforce this code of conduct in any manner deemed appropriate. Anyone violating the code of conduct may be: (a) asked to stop, (b) subjected to limits on or revocation of any means of active participation in the workshop (i.e., muted microphone, blocked video access, removed Slack access), (c) expelled from the workshop. Establishing and enforcing this code of conduct is intended to prevent incidents of harassment, discrimination, and incivility, and to maintain a high quality of scientific discourse.\n\n[1] Disagreements about science are normal and healthy parts of academic discourse. Civil and constructive criticism of someone’s work for a perceived methodological flaw or a misinterpretation of results is appropriate. Demeaning a scientist for being sloppy, misleading or stupid and other ad hominem attacks are inappropriate.\n\nPolicy on liability\n\nInstructors shall not be responsible for any defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of all participants, and shall not be held liable for or damage of any kind suffered by the participants at or in connection with the event. By registering for and attending the workshop, each participant acknowledges that they have read this Disclaimer, and expressly releases the instructors from any and all liability in connection with the workshop.\n\nProcedures\n\nViolations of the Code of Conduct are reportable to any of the instructors via direct message on Slack or email (see table below). In the case that a workshop attendee or instructor wishes to report inappropriate behavior of one of the workshop instructors, please consider contacting an instructor at a different institution.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Instructor Name\n      Email\n      Institution\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Carl Rothfels\n      crothfels@berkeley.edu\n      UC Berkeley\n    \n    \n      Cindy Looy\n      looy@berkeley.edu\n      UC Berkeley\n    \n    \n      Michael Sundue\n      sundue@gmail.com\n      University of Vermont\n    \n    \n      Michael May\n      mikeryanmay@gmail.com\n      UC Berkeley\n    \n    \n      Benjamin Muddiman\n      bmuddiman@berkeley.edu\n      UC Berkeley\n    \n    \n      Ixchel González-Ramírez\n      ixchel_gonzalezrmz@berkeley.edu\n      UC Berkeley\n    \n  \n\n",
