In recent years, Bayesian total-evidence dating has emerged as one of the premiere strategies for dating phylogenetic trees.
However, in practice, total-evidence dating requires a great deal of biological, paleontological, and statistical expertise.
Our workshop is intended to empower phylogeneticists interested in using total-evidence dating by providing: 1) a solid foundation in relevant statistical phylogenetics; 2) discussion of relevant empirical considerations, in particular how to deal with morphology and the fossil record, and; 3) hands-on experience with software, particularly [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/).

The course will begin on March XX and run for 5 weeks (ending week of May YY).
Each week, we will discuss a particular topic related to total-evidence dating (Tuesday), provide experience with related methods with relevant hands-on tutorials (to be done throughout the week), and hold office hours to discuss the weekly topic and to help with practical issues that arise during the tutorials (Friday).
See our [Syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus) for more details about the topics covered each week.
