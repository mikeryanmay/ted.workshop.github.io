I"Q<p>In recent years, Bayesian total-evidence dating has emerged as one of the premiere strategies for divergence-time estimation.
However, in practice, total-evidence dating requires a great deal of biological, paleontological, and statistical expertise.
Our workshop is intended to empower phylogeneticists interested in using total-evidence dating by providing: 1) a solid foundation in relevant statistical phylogenetics; 2) exposure to the computati</p>

<p>The course will begin on March XX and run for 5 weeks (ending week of May YY).
Each week, we will discuss a particular topic related to total-evidence dating (Tuesday), provide experience with related methods with relevant hands-on tutorials (to be done throughout the week), and hold office hours to discuss the weekly topic and to help with practical issues that arise during the tutorials (Friday).
