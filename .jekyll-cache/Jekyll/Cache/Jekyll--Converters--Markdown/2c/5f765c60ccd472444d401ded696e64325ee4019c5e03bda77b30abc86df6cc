I"o<p>In recent years, the Bayesian TED framework has emerged as one of the premiere strategies for divergence-time estimation.
One of the main advantages of this framework over traditional node-based dating approaches is that it relieves the investigator of the usually fraught, subjective, and somewhat circular task of determining the topological and temporal relationships among the extinct taxa and their extant relatives \emph{a priori}.
In trade, TED requires the investigator not only to assemble a reliable morphological dataset, but also to specify explicit models that describe how morphological characters evolve, how rates of evolution vary across the tree, and how (extant and extinct) clades are distributed in time.
% Owing to the small sizes of most morphological datasets (relative to their molecular counterparts) and details of the statistical model (namely, nonidentifiability), we expect phylogenetic estimates to be sensitive to these modeling decisions.
Rigorous application of the TED framework therefore requires a great deal of empirical and statistical expertise.</p>

<p>The course will begin on March XX and run for 5 weeks (ending week of May YY).
Each week, we will discuss a particular topic related to total-evidence dating (Tuesday), provide experience with related methods with relevant hands-on tutorials (to be done throughout the week), and hold office hours to discuss the weekly topic and to help with practical issues that arise during the tutorials (Friday).
See our <a href="/ted.workshop.github.io/syllabus">Syllabus</a> for more details about the topics covered each week.</p>
